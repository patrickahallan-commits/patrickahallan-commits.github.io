**Return Differentials and the US Current Account** A study on the "exorbitant privilege and exorbitant duty" of US capital flows
[PDF](files/JMP_Hallan.pdf)

**Abstract.** This paper studies the role of return differentials—the excess yield the United States earns on its external
assets relative to what it pays on its liabilities—in shaping the U.S. current account. Using BEA international
transactions and investment-position data, I construct quarterlymeasures of total, direct-investment (DI), and
portfolio-investment (PI) return differentials for 2006Q1–2025Q1. Descriptive accounting shows that these wedges
cumulate to trillions of dollars in effective current-account support, with DI persistently positive and PI more
volatile. To identify causal effects, I estimate VARX models in levels and sign-restricted SVARs with DI, PI, monetarypolicy,
and exchange-rate shocks. The results show that DI shocks generate clear and persistent contractions in
the current account balance, while PI shocks are smaller, less robustly signed, but quantitatively important for
medium-horizon variance. Forecast-error variance decompositions indicate that return-differential shocks account
for about one-tenth of C A/GDP fluctuations, comparable to monetary and exchange-rate shocks. Additionally,
Historical decompositions link these dynamics to the global financial crisis, Covid-19, and phases of dollar strength.
This paper interprets the evidence under the duality "exorbitant privilege-exorbitant duty" of the United States as
the supplier of the key currency to the global economy.
