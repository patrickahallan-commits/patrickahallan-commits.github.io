title: "Teaching"
---

My teaching is guided by humanist-constructivist pedagogies inspired by my experiences with social organizations in Brazil and the work of Paulo Freire. I view students as individuals inserted in a given historical context, afected social, political, and technological paradigms. While knowledge is informed by both scientific practice and social convention, successful learning processes require a balance between disciplinary structure and space for individual critical thinking. My classes favor a dialogical approach that encourages students to constantly reassess and critique the dominant paradigms.

    “Once again, human beings, challenged by the dramatic nature of the present moment, 
    set themselves up, before themselves, as a problem. They discover that they know 
    little about themselves, about their ‘place in the cosmos,’ and they grow restless 
    to know more. Indeed, it is in the recognition of their limited knowledge of themselves 
    that one of the reasons for this search lies. In the almost, if not tragic, discovery 
    of their own lack of self-knowledge, they become a problem to themselves. 
    They inquire. They respond, and their responses lead them to new questions.”
