# About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of Utah. My research lies at the intersection of international finance, political economy, and the history of economic thought. I study how financial hierarchies and imperial relations shape exchange rates, return differentials, and development outcomes.

My dissertation, *Three Essays on Modern Imperialism: World Hegemony, US Return Differentials, and Unequal Exchange*, connects classical theories of imperialism to contemporary debates on the international monetary and financial system (IMFS) and international financial subordination (IFS).

Beyond research, I’m passionate about teaching. I have taught Intermediate Microeconomics, Money and Banking, and International Economics. My teaching philosophy—rooted in humanist-constructivist pedagogy—emphasizes clarity, participation, and intellectual rigor.

## Outside Academia

Originally from Brazil, I bring a global perspective to my work and teaching. Outside research, I enjoy [a line or two about interests—e.g., hiking in Utah, reading history & philosophy].
