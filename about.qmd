# About Me



I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of Utah. My research lies at the intersection of international finance, political economy, and the history of economic thought. I study how financial hierarchies and imperial relations shape exchange rates, return differentials, and development outcomes.

My dissertation, *Three Essays on Modern Imperialism: World Hegemony, US Return Differentials, and International Financial Subordination, connects classical theories of imperialism to contemporary debates on the international monetary and financial system (IMFS) and international financial subordination (IFS).

Originally from Brazil, I have worked with rural and urban social movements, including the Landless Movement (Movimento Sem Terra), student and labor union.
I see in the youth the power to fight for social justice and change.
