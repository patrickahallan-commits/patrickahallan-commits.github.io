Hi, and welcome to my website!

I’m Patrick Hallan, a Ph.D. candidate in the
[Department of Economics at the University of Utah](https://www.econ.utah.edu/){target="_blank"}.
I study global financial asymmetries and how they shape the development paths of
Emerging and Developing Economies (EDEs). I am also interested in themes in the history of
economic thought, particularly in classical political economy, and in the epistemology of
the social sciences and its implications for theoretical and empirical practices in economics.
