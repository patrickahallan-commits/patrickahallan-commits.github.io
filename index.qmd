      Hi, welcome to my website! My name is Patrick and I am a Ph.D candidate at the University of Utah.
## About me
I study global financial asymmetries and how they shape the development paths of Emerging and Developing Economies (EDEs). I am also interested in themes in the history of economic thought, particularly in the traditions of classical political economy, and in the epistemology of the social sciences and its implications to theoretical and empirical practices in economics.
    </p>

## My teaching philosophy
  My teaching is guided by what I call a humanist-constructivist pedagogy--inspired by my experiences with social organizations in Brazil and the thought of Paulo Freire. My view it that students are individuals inserted in a given historical context, afected by a set of social, political, and technological paradigms. Knowledge is informed by both scientific practice and social convention. Successful learning processes require a balance between disciplinary structure and space for individual critical thinking. My classes favor a dialogical approach that encourages students to constantly reassess and critique the dominant paradigms.

    “Once again, human beings, challenged by the dramatic nature of the present moment, 
    set themselves up, before themselves, as a problem. They discover that they know 
    little about themselves, about their ‘place in the cosmos,’ and they grow restless 
    to know more. Indeed, it is in the recognition of their limited knowledge of themselves 
    that one of the reasons for this search lies. In the almost, if not tragic, discovery 
    of their own lack of self-knowledge, they become a problem to themselves. 
    They inquire. They respond, and their responses lead them to new questions.”  
    <br>— <strong>Paulo Freire</strong>, <em>Pedagogy of the Oppressed</em>
