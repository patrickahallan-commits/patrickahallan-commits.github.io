      I’m Patrick Hallan, a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Economics at the University of Utah. 
      I study global financial asymmetries and how they shape the development paths of 
      Emerging and Developing Economies (EDEs). I am also interested in themes in the history of economic thought, 
      particularly in classical political economy, and in the epistemology of the social sciences and its implications 
      for theoretical and empirical practices in economics.
