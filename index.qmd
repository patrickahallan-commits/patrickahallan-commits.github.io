      I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of Utah. I study how global financial asymmetries shape exchange rates, capital flows, and development outcomes. I am also interested in themes in the history of economic thought, particularly within the tradition of classical political economy, and in the epistemology of the social sciences, where my primary influence is critical realism.

    “Once again, human beings, challenged by the dramatic nature of the present moment, 
    set themselves up, before themselves, as a problem. They discover that they know 
    little about themselves, about their ‘place in the cosmos,’ and they grow restless 
    to know more. Indeed, it is in the recognition of their limited knowledge of themselves 
    that one of the reasons for this search lies. In the almost, if not tragic, discovery 
    of their own lack of self-knowledge, they become a problem to themselves. 
    They inquire. They respond, and their responses lead them to new questions.”  
    <br>— Paulo Freire, <em>Pedagogy of the Oppressed</em>
