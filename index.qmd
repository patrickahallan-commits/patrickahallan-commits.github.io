      I am a Ph.D candidate at the University of Utah. I study global financial asymmetries and how they shape the development paths of Emerging and Developing Economies (EDEs). I am also interested in themes in the history of economic thought, particularly in classical political economy, and in the epistemology of the social sciences and its implications to theoretical and empirical practices in economics.
